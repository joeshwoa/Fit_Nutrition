final String AshwagandhaInfo =
    "Ashwagandha is an evergreen shrub that grows in Asia and Africa.It is commonly used for stress. There is little evidence for its use as an 'adaptogen'.\n\n" +
        "Ashwagandha contains chemicals that might help calm the brain, reduce swelling, lower blood pressure, and alter the immune system.\n\n" +
        "Since ashwagandha is traditionally used as an adaptogen, it is used for many conditions related to stress. Adaptogens are believed to help the body resist physical and mental stress. Some of the conditions it is used for include insomnia, aging, anxiety and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using ashwagandha for COVID-19.\n\n" +
        "Don't confuse ashwagandha with Physalis alkekengi. Both are known as winter cherry. Also, don't confuse ashwagandha with American ginseng, Panax ginseng, or eleuthero.\n\n";
final String BcaaInfo =
    "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are essential nutrients including leucine, isoleucine, and valine. They're found in meat, dairy, and legumes.\n\n" +
        "BCAAs stimulate the building of protein in muscle and possibly reduce muscle breakdown. The 'Branched-chain' refers to the chemical structure of these amino acids.\n\n" +
        "BCAAs are used for reduced brain function in people with advanced liver disease and for a movement disorder often caused by antipsychotic drugs. They are also commonly used to improve athletic performance, prevent fatigue, reduce muscle breakdown, and other purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to support these other uses.\n\n";
final String CitrullineInfo =
    "L-citrulline is an amino acid found in watermelon. It is also made in the body. The body changes L-citrulline into another amino acid called L-arginine.\n\n" +
        "The name citrulline comes from Citrullus vulgaris, the Latin term for watermelon. Unlike some amino acids, L-citrulline isn't used to make protein, but it might help increase other chemicals the body needs to make protein. It might also help improve blood flow and reduce blood pressure.\n\n" +
        "People use L-citrulline for athletic performance, sickle cell disease, erectile dysfunction (ED), high blood pressure in the lungs, heart disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.\n\n";
final String CreatineInfo =
    "Creatine is a chemical found naturally in the body. It's also in red meat and seafood. It is often used to improve exercise performance and muscle mass.\n\n" +
        "Creatine is involved in making energy for muscles. About 95% of it is found in skeletal muscle. The majority of sports supplements in the US contain creatine. People who have lower creatine levels when they start taking creatine seem to get more benefit than people who start with higher levels.\n\n" +
        "People commonly use creatine for improving exercise performance and increasing muscle mass. It is also used for muscle cramps, fatigue, multiple sclerosis (MS), depression, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.\n\n" +
        "Creatine use is allowed by the International Olympic Committee and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\n\n";
final String FishOilInfo =
    "Fish oil comes from many types of fish. It is rich in two important omega-3 fatty acids called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).\n\n" +
        "The benefits of fish oil seem to come from its omega-3 fatty acid content. Fish that are especially rich in these oils include mackerel, herring, tuna, and salmon. The body doesn't produce many of its own omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce pain and swelling, and also prevent the blood from clotting easily.\n\n" +
        "Some fish oil products are approved by the FDA as prescription medications to lower triglycerides levels. Fish oil is also available as a supplement. Fish oil supplements do not contain the same amount of fish oil as prescription products, so they cannot be used in place of prescription products. Fish oil supplements are sometimes used for heart health and mental health, but there is no strong evidence to support most of these uses.\n\n" +
        "Do not confuse fish oil with EPA, DHA, cod liver oil, flaxseed oil, krill oil, or shark liver oil. See the separate listings for these topics.\n\n";
final String VitaminDInfo =
    "Vitamin D is an essential vitamin that helps regulate calcium and phosphorus in the body. It also plays a role in maintaining proper bone structure.\n\n" +
        "There are different forms of vitamin D, including ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Vitamin D is found in fish, eggs, and fortified milk. It's also made in the skin when exposed to sunlight. During periods of sunlight, vitamin D is stored in fat and then released when sunlight is not available.\n\n" +
        "Vitamin D supplements are commonly used to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency. People who don't get enough sun and people who are 65 years or older are at risk for deficiency. People also use vitamin D for weak and brittle bones, heart disease, asthma, hay fever, and many other conditions, but there's no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no strong evidence to support using vitamin D supplements for COVID-19. But it is important to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D. This can be done by taking 400-1000 IU of vitamin D daily or spending 15-30 minutes in the sun each day.\n\n";
